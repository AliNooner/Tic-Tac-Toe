## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a fun, easy game that people of all ages can enjoy! For this underwater adventure version, a Mermaid player and Fish player go tail-to-tail to see who can collect the most wins. Players are able to jump right into gameplay on page load and the board will reset after a game is won or declared a draw.

## Features

- Tic Tac Toe is a two player game. Player 1 and player 2 are able to alternate turns until either player is able to declare 3 spots in a row, column, or diagonal on a game board consisting of 9 squares. Game play also stops if all 9 spaces on the board have been taken and no player has achieved 3 places in a row, resulting in a draw.
- After a win or draw, the game board resets for another round of fun!
- With each win, the player's individual number of wins are displayed within their player column. Total number of wins per player are able to carry on across page refreshes.
